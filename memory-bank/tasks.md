## DEBUG SESSION 10: Template Syntax Error & Button Functionality
**Date:** Previous
**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**Issue:** Jinja2 template syntax error in booking_detail.html line 272 and non-functional edit/delete buttons in my_bookings.html

### Problems Identified:
1. **Template Syntax Error**: TemplateSyntaxError in booking_detail.html: "expected token 'end of statement block', got '%'"
2. **Missing Functionality**: Edit and Cancel buttons in my_bookings.html were not connected to any routes

### Root Causes:
1. **Hidden Character Issue**: Extra invisible character at end of file in booking_detail.html after `{% endblock %}`
2. **Missing Routes**: No backend routes existed for editing or canceling bookings
3. **Non-functional Buttons**: Buttons were static HTML without proper href links or form actions

### Solutions Implemented:

#### 1. Fixed Template Syntax Error
- **File**: `app/templates/booking/booking_detail.html`
- **Action**: Recreated entire template file to remove hidden characters
- **Fix**: Replaced problematic `{% endblock %} ` with clean `{% endblock %}`

#### 2. Added Missing Backend Routes
- **File**: `app/blueprints/booking.py`
- **New Routes Added**:
  ```python
  @booking_bp.route('/booking/<int:booking_id>/edit')
  @login_required
  def edit_booking(booking_id):
      # Redirects to contact info with helpful message
  
  @booking_bp.route('/booking/<int:booking_id>/cancel', methods=['POST'])  
  @login_required
  def cancel_booking(booking_id):
      # Updates booking status to 'cancelled'
  ```

#### 3. Connected Buttons to Routes
- **File**: `app/templates/booking/my_bookings.html`
- **Changes**:
  - Replaced modal trigger with direct link to `booking.view_booking`
  - Connected "Edit" button to `booking.edit_booking` route
  - Added POST form for "Cancel" button with confirmation dialog
  - Updated modal footer with proper "View Full Details" link

#### 4. Enhanced User Experience
- **Edit Functionality**: Redirects to contact info (professional approach)
- **Cancel Functionality**: Updates database with confirmation dialog
- **Status Protection**: Only allows canceling 'pending' and 'confirmed' bookings
- **Error Handling**: Proper flash messages and redirects

### Business Logic:
- Edit bookings redirect to contact Ahmed Khalil at (708) 971-4053
- Cancel functionality updates booking status to 'cancelled' in database
- Only pending bookings show edit/cancel options
- Confirmation required before cancellation
- All changes logged with updated_at timestamp

### Files Modified:
1. `app/templates/booking/booking_detail.html` - Fixed syntax error by recreation
2. `app/blueprints/booking.py` - Added edit_booking and cancel_booking routes
