                    <p class="lead">At Fixbulance LLC, customer satisfaction is our top priority. We stand behind the quality of our mobile phone repair services and replacement parts. If for any reason you are not fully satisfied, please review our refund policy below.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-primary mt-4">1. Eligibility for Refunds</h3>
                    <p>You may be eligible for a refund under the following conditions:</p>
                    
                    <h5 class="mt-3">Service Refunds:</h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li>If we are unable to complete the repair due to part unavailability or technical limitations, a full or partial refund will be issued.</li>
                        <li>If you cancel a scheduled repair at least 24 hours in advance, you are eligible for a full refund.</li>
                        <li>If the service was completed but the issue persists, we will first attempt a free re-repair. If the issue is still unresolved, a partial refund may be offered at our discretion.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h5 class="mt-3">Part Refunds:</h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Replacement parts come with a 90-day limited warranty. If a part malfunctions due to a defect (not physical or liquid damage), it will be replaced or refunded according to our warranty terms.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 class="text-primary mt-4">2. Non-Refundable Items</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Diagnostic fees (if applicable) are non-refundable once the service has begun.</li>
                        <li>Services that were successfully completed and meet the expected repair standard are not eligible for refunds.</li>
                        <li>Damage caused by the user after the repair (e.g., drops, water exposure) voids any eligibility for a refund or re-repair.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 class="text-primary mt-4">3. Process for Requesting a Refund</h3>
                    <p>To request a refund:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Email us at <a href="mailto:support@fixbulance.com" class="text-decoration-none">support@fixbulance.com</a> or call us at <a href="tel:+17089714053" class="text-decoration-none">(708) 971-4053</a></li>
                        <li>Include your name, service date, device model, and a description of the issue</li>
                        <li>Allow up to 5–7 business days for refund processing once approved</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h3 class="text-primary mt-4">4. Warranty vs. Refund</h3>
                    <p>Our repairs are backed by a limited warranty. In most cases, we aim to resolve issues through warranty-based rework before processing a refund.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-primary mt-4">5. Payment Method & Timeline</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Refunds are issued to the original payment method (credit/debit card, cash, etc.)</li>
                        <li>Depending on your bank or provider, refunds may take 3–10 business days to reflect in your account</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 class="text-primary mt-4">6. Changes to this Policy</h3>
                    <p>Fixbulance reserves the right to modify this refund policy at any time without notice. Any updates will be posted to our website.</p>
