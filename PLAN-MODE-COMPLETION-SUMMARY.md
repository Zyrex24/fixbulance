## 🎯 CREATIVE PHASE REQUIREMENTS

### 4 Design Decisions Identified for Resolution

#### 1. 🎨 Customer Booking Flow Design
- **Problem**: Optimize mobile booking experience for on-site repairs
- **Options**: Single-page form vs multi-step wizard approach
- **Decision Needed**: Balance information collection with user experience simplicity

#### 2. 🎨 Admin Dashboard Layout
- **Problem**: Efficient order management for single-operator business
- **Options**: List view vs card view vs calendar view
- **Decision Needed**: Mobile-optimized admin interface for van-based operations

#### 3. 🏗️ Service Radius Calculation Strategy
- **Problem**: Dynamic service area validation with customer privacy
- **Options**: Client-side vs server-side location validation
- **Decision Needed**: Performance vs privacy balance for 10-mile radius

#### 4. 🏗️ Real-time Communication Architecture
- **Problem**: Customer-operator communication during repairs
- **Options**: Basic email vs SMS integration vs in-app messaging
- **Decision Needed**: Cost vs functionality for budget version constraints
