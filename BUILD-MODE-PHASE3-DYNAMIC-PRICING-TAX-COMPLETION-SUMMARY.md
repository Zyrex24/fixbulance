## üîß TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

### **Feature 6: Dynamic Pricing System**

**Files Modified:**
```
‚úÖ app/templates/booking/step3_details.html

**JavaScript Architecture:**
```javascript
// Event-driven pricing updates
deviceModelSelect.addEventListener('change') ‚Üí loadDevicePricing()
‚Üí displayPricingOptions() ‚Üí selectServiceOption() ‚Üí updatePricingSummary()

// Tax integration
updatePricingSummary() includes tax calculation using IL rates
```

**API Endpoint Structure:**
```json
GET /booking/api/device-pricing/iPhone/iPhone%2015%20Pro
{
  "success": true,
  "pricing": {
    "brand": "iPhone",
    "model": "iPhone 15 Pro", 
    "available_services": [
      {
        "type": "screen_original",
        "name": "Original Screen Replacement",
        "price": 299.99,
        "category": "Screen"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### **Feature 7: Tax Implementation**

**Database Migration:**
```sql
‚úÖ Added 5 new fields to booking table:
   - tax_rate FLOAT DEFAULT 0.1025
   - tax_amount FLOAT DEFAULT 0.0  
   - subtotal FLOAT DEFAULT 0.0
   - total_with_tax FLOAT DEFAULT 0.0
   - tax_jurisdiction VARCHAR(100) DEFAULT 'Illinois'

‚úÖ Migration Results: Updated 14 existing bookings successfully
```

**Tax Calculation System:**
```python
# Location-based tax rates
Illinois Tax Rates by ZIP Code:
- Chicago (606-609): 10.25%
- DuPage County (604): 9.25%  
- Lake County (605): 8.75%
- Suburban Cook (600-601): 8.25%
- Default Illinois: 6.25%
```

**Methods Added to Booking Model:**
```python
‚úÖ calculate_tax(service_price=None)
   - Calculates tax based on service location
   - Updates all tax-related fields
   - Returns comprehensive tax breakdown

‚úÖ get_tax_rate_by_location()
   - ZIP code prefix-based rate lookup
   - Returns appropriate Illinois tax rate

‚úÖ tax_breakdown property
   - Formatted display values for UI
   - Currency formatting and percentage display
```

**Integration Points:**
- **Dynamic Pricing**: JavaScript calls tax calculation in real-time
- **Booking Flow**: Tax calculated and stored during booking creation
- **Payment Processing**: Tax amount included in final payment calculations

### **Feature 8: Location Data Verification**

**Verification Results:**
```
‚úÖ CONFIRMED: Customer location data collection is CORRECT
‚úÖ VERIFIED: No confusion between customer and service provider locations
‚úÖ VALIDATED: Address fields properly store customer service location
‚úÖ TESTED: Tax calculation properly uses customer ZIP code
```

**Location Data Flow:**
```
step4_location.html (Customer enters address) 
‚Üí service_address, service_city, service_state, service_zip_code
‚Üí Booking model stores customer location
‚Üí Tax calculation uses service_zip_code
‚Üí Service delivery to customer location
```

**Database Fields Confirmed:**
```python
service_address = db.Column(db.Text, nullable=False)      # Customer address ‚úÖ
service_city = db.Column(db.String(100))                  # Customer city ‚úÖ
service_state = db.Column(db.String(2), default='IL')     # Customer state ‚úÖ
service_zip_code = db.Column(db.String(10), index=True)   # Customer ZIP ‚úÖ
```
