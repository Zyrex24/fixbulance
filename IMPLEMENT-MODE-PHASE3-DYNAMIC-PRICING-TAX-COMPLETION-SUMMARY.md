- **Compliance Ready**: Accurate tax jurisdiction tracking

**Database Fields Added:**
```python
tax_rate = db.Column(db.Float, default=0.1025)
tax_amount = db.Column(db.Float, default=0.0)
subtotal = db.Column(db.Float, default=0.0)
total_with_tax = db.Column(db.Float, default=0.0)
tax_jurisdiction = db.Column(db.String(100), default='Illinois')
```

**Methods Implemented:**
- `calculate_tax()` - Main tax calculation method
- `get_tax_rate_by_location()` - Location-based rate lookup
- `tax_breakdown` property - Formatted display values

**Business Benefits:**
- **Tax Compliance**: Accurate tax calculation by location
- **Transparent Pricing**: Clear tax breakdown for customers
- **Legal Compliance**: Proper tax collection and tracking

**Verification Results:**
- ✅ **Correct Data Collection**: Form collects customer service address
- ✅ **Proper Storage**: Booking model stores customer location accurately  
- ✅ **No Data Confusion**: Clear distinction between customer and provider locations
- ✅ **Service Area Validation**: Working verification system

**Location Fields Confirmed:**
```python
service_address = db.Column(db.Text, nullable=False)
service_city = db.Column(db.String(100))
service_state = db.Column(db.String(2), default='IL')
service_zip_code = db.Column(db.String(10), nullable=False, index=True)
```

**Business Benefits:**
- **Accurate Service Delivery**: Correct customer location collection
- **Efficient Operations**: No location data confusion
- **Service Area Management**: Proper radius validation
